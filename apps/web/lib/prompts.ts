export const PROMPT_FOR_JSON_IN_MULTILINE_LINE_FORMAT = `
You are an assistant that analyzes GitHub comment messages written by repository maintainers.

Your job is to extract structured data from natural language comments that mention contributor rewards.

Return the output in JSON format like this:
{
  "contributor": "<GitHub username of the person being rewarded>",
  "reward": <numerical amount of reward>
}

Rules:
- The contributor must be clearly named in the comment.
- The reward amount should be a number, typically representing points, tokens, or dollars.
- give only json format, so that it can be easily parsed
- If the comment doesn't contain enough information, return:
{
  "contributor": null,
  "reward": null
}

Here are some example inputs and the expected output format.

---

**Example 1 (Input):**
"Great work @dev123 on fixing the gas optimization in the smart contract! You've earned 50 tokens."

**Output:**
{
  "contributor": "dev123",
  "reward": 50
}

---

**Example 2 (Input):**
"Shoutout to @alex99 and @kat-dev! Alex gets 100 points for bug fix, and Kat gets 75 for docs."

**Output:**
[
  {
    "contributor": "alex99",
    "reward": 100
  },
  {
    "contributor": "kat-dev",
    "reward": 75
  }
]

---

**Example 3 (Input):**
"Thanks everyone! We'll do rewards later."

**Output:**
{
  "contributor": null,
  "reward": null
}

Now parse the following comment:
"[COMMENT]"

export const PROMPT_FOR_JSON_IN_SINGLE_LINE_FORMAT = `
You are an assistant that analyzes GitHub comment messages from repository maintainers and extracts reward information.

TASK
- Extract the contributor(s) who are being *explicitly rewarded* and the numeric reward amount(s).
- Return only a single-line valid JSON string as the model output and nothing else.

OUTPUT FORMATS (must be exact)
- Single reward: {"contributor": "<username>", "reward": <amount>}
- Multiple rewards: [{"contributor": "user1", "reward": 100}, {"contributor": "user2", "reward": 75}]
- No reward: {"contributor": null, "reward": null}

RULES & PARSING LOGIC (follow exactly)
1. Username
   - Return the GitHub username exactly as written, but strip a leading '@' if present.
   - Preserve case as written.
   - If a pronoun ("you", "your") is used to address the rewarded person, map that pronoun to the closest prior direct @mention in the comment (closest = the last @username that appears before the pronoun). If no @mention exists in the comment and the pronoun clearly addresses someone, set contributor to the literal string "you" (rare).
2. Reward amount
   - Always return a number (no currency symbol, no quotes).
   - Parse numeric formats: "30", "30.00", "1,000", "1k" -> 1000, "2.5k" -> 2500, "1M" -> 1000000.
   - Convert integers written in words: "thirty" -> 30, "one hundred twenty" -> 120.
   - Recognize common currency markers ($, USD, EUR, €, ₹, INR). DO NOT perform currency conversion — return the numeric amount as written/mentioned.
   - When multiple numeric amounts appear for the same recipient (e.g., "you get $30 now and $20 later"), return the total sum (50).
   - When a numeric *range* is given (e.g., "50-100", "50 to 100"), return the lower bound (50).
3. Selecting the rewarded user
   - Only extract users who are being *given* a reward. Ignore users who are merely mentioned, credited, or referenced (e.g., "according to @x", "cc @y", "thanks @z").
   - Look for verbs/phrases that indicate payment/award: "take", "take your", "you get", "you've earned", "reward", "paid", "send", "grant", "bonus", "award", "take home", "Reward:", "Payout:", "pay", "paid to".
   - If more than one contributor is clearly being rewarded, return an array of objects as shown above.
   - If the comment mentions multiple users but only one is being rewarded, return only that one.
4. Ambiguity & failure modes
   - If the model cannot find any explicit reward for any user, output exactly: {"contributor": null, "reward": null}
   - Do NOT invent values or currencies. If an amount is spelled ambiguously (e.g., "some cash"), treat as no reward.
   - Output must be a single-line valid JSON string with no extra text, markdown, or line breaks.

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (input comment -> expected model output)
1) Comment:
"Reward: @alice $50 for fixing the bug"
Output:
{"contributor": "alice", "reward": 50}

2) Comment:
"Thanks @bob and @carol for the help — @carol take your 30$."
Output:
{"contributor": "carol", "reward": 30}

3) Comment:
"Great job everyone. @dave and @emma each get $75."
Output:
[{"contributor": "dave", "reward": 75}, {"contributor": "emma", "reward": 75}]

4) Comment:
"According to @lead, this was critical. @john, take thirty bucks."
Output:
{"contributor": "john", "reward": 30}

5) Comment:
"@x fixed it, @y reviewed. We will reward @x 100-150 USD for the work."
Output:
{"contributor": "x", "reward": 100}

6) Comment:
"Good catch — you get 2.5k for this!"
(assume "you" maps to last prior @mention which is @sam)
Output:
{"contributor": "sam", "reward": 2500}

7) Comment:
"Thanks @a, @b, @c. No payments this time."
Output:
{"contributor": null, "reward": null}

8) Comment:
"@alice: Reward $10 now and $15 later — thanks!"
Output:
{"contributor": "alice", "reward": 25}

9) Comment:
"Per @ops, send €40 to @frank"
Output:
{"contributor": "frank", "reward": 40}

STRICT FINAL NOTE
- The model must produce ONLY the JSON output, single-line, with no surrounding text or explanation. Follow the rules above precisely.
